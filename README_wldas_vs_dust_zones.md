Using `WLDAS_utils/wldas_utils.py`. Results in `WLDAS_hist_plots`. Using WLDAS data from 2001-2020. 

Blue line is the frequency distribution of the variable over the whole region (latitudes from 27.5 to 44, longitudes from -128 to -100). 

Orange line is the frequency distribution of the variable over regions that have been recorded as a dust origin (0.1 deg x 0.1 deg squares). This is visualized in 0_masking_example (on Google Drive). 

Both methods use the full time range from 2001-2020.
